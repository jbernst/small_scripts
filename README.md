# Small scripts for BASH coding and learning
The code chunks and scripts in this repository are for a variety of uses, from learning commands and arguements to tips and tricks to help with small jobs (e.g., renaming files).

This list will be updated with time.

## The Basics
Learning the command line can be tricky. To get started, the first thing to learn is how to navigate through directories (commonly known as 'folders'). These directories are set up in a hierarchical fashion on your system. In the example below, there is a directory called ```Data```. Within this directory, there are three files: ```Spreadsheet.xlsx```, ```Summary.docx```, ```Rawdata.txt```. The directory called ```Data``` is called the parenty directory of the three files within it. 

Data  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreadsheet.xlsx  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary.docx  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rawdata.txt

To learn how to navigate the terminal, as well as try some helpful commands for listing and manipulating files, check the following list of commands:

## Touching Files
Sometimes we need to update the date and time of our files. For example, if a computer cluster has a 90-day limit on files, in which files >90 days will be purged, you can use the command ```touch``` to update the files. For a short script on updating all files recursively from within a directory, check here:
